PLACEHOLDER FILE
================

Replace this folder with your actual CertificateInstaller.exe file.

The download link in the website points to:
/downloads/CertificateInstaller.exe

Make sure to:
1. Place your .exe file in this directory (public/downloads/)
2. Name it exactly: CertificateInstaller.exe
3. Update the version number in DownloadPage.tsx if needed

This placeholder file can be deleted once you add your actual installer.
